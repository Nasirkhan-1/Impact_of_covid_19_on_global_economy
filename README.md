Impact of COVID-19 on the Global Economy

The COVID-19 pandemic brought unprecedented challenges to economies worldwide, affecting public health, industries, and financial stability on a massive scale. In this analysis, we have conducted a comprehensive study of the pandemicâ€™s impact on the global economy using real-world data and Python-based analysis.

Our study examines key factors such as the total number of COVID-19 cases and deaths across different countries, allowing us to identify regions that were most severely affected. We also explore country-wise comparisons to highlight variations in infection rates, mortality rates, and government responses.

Beyond the health crisis, the economic repercussions of the pandemic were significant. We analyze GDP trends by comparing economic performance before and after the pandemic, providing insights into how different economies struggled or adapted during this period. Additionally, we assess the Human Development Index (HDI) post-COVID to understand how the pandemic influenced overall societal well-being, including life expectancy, education, and living standards.

By leveraging data visualization and statistical techniques, this study offers a data-driven perspective on how COVID-19 reshaped the global economy. The findings from this analysis can help policymakers, researchers, and economists better understand the long-term economic and social consequences of the pandemic.
